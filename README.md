This is BujaSaT project.
#  BujaSaT stands for Bujumbura Safe Travel
A project for helping people find easily places in Bujumbura, Capital City of Burundi.
Developed in response to easiness of finding places, I do believe in simplicity and to achieve that this requires a difficult job.
I didn't know nothing about the technical side of this project at the beginning. I struggled in order to let my idea come to life.
